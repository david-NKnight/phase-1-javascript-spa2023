The project is a Single Page Application (SPA) that displays a random fox image each time the user clicks the "New Image" button. It also includes a "Send Image" button for the user to send the displayed image to someone. The application uses the Random Fox API to fetch the random fox image and display it on the page. 

Random Fox SPA
This is a simple Single Page Application (SPA) that displays a random image of a fox from the Random Fox API.

Getting Started
To use this app, you can simply open the index.html file in your web browser. Alternatively, you can also host the files on a web server to make it accessible online.

How to Use
Once the app is loaded in your browser, click on the "New Image" button to display a random image of a fox. You can click on the button multiple times to see different fox images.

If you want to send the displayed image to someone, you can click on the "Send Image" button to copy the image URL to your clipboard. You can then paste the URL into an email or chat message to share it with others.

Code Overview
The app is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main code can be found in the index.html and style.css files, which handle the layout and styling of the page. The JavaScript code is included in the <script> tag at the end of the index.html file.

The JavaScript code fetches a random image URL from the Random Fox API when the "New Image" button is clicked, and displays the image on the page using the img tag with the ID "fox-image". The "Send Image" button is used to copy the image URL to the clipboard when clicked.
